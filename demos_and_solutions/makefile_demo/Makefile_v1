# rule for making the program:
# it depends on having the .o files,
# then the body of the rule links them together
myprogram : separate.o whatever.o
	icpc -o myprogram separate.o whatever.o
# Note: <TAB> characters for indentation.
# use emacs.

# technical explanation of how make rules work:
# if the target is older than the prerequisite,
#   (or does not exist at all)
# then the target needs to be regenerated:
#   execute the rule (wherever you find it)
# this is applied recursively:
#   the prerequisites are themselves created
#    or updated as needed.
separate.o : separate.cxx
	icpc -c separate.cxx
whatever.o : whatever.cxx
	icpc -c whatever.cxx

# this rule only indicates a dependency:
# if the .h file changes,
# then both targets need to be regenerated
separate.o whatever.o : whatever.h

# it is a good idea to have a `clean' rule
#   for deleting binary junk and 
#   temporary files.
clean :
	rm -f *.o *~
